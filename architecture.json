  "cover_prompt": "A solitary Scottish satirist, his face etched with wry defiance, feverishly annotates a crumbling, mythic map of Caledonia with a leaky fountain pen, surrounded by empty glasses and scattered pages in the smoky haze of a Prague pub, [Detailed Scene & Context]. The scene is rendered in the atmospheric style of a fusion between the stark, psychological etchings of Käthe Kollwitz and the brooding, literary chiaroscuro of Edward Hopper's interior narratives, [Artistic Style & Medium]. Book cover framing, a tightly centered composition that feels both intimate and claustrophobic, shot from a low dramatic angle that elevates the writer to a monumental figure amidst the pub's detritus, [Composition & Camera]. The lighting is a masterful play of tenebrism, where a single, grimy overhead lamp carves the writer and his work out of the deep shadows, casting long, distorted silhouettes of bar stools like accusing specters; the color palette is a somber symphony of sepia ink stains, the warm amber of old whisky and lamplight, and the cold, melancholic blues of a Prague night seen through a fogged window, [Lighting & Color Palette]. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev, [Quality & Technical Enforcers]."
